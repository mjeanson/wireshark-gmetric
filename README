wireshark-gmetric
==================

gmetric dissector plugin for wireshark

Build and install
-----------------

1. Create a build directory and move to it, for example "mkdir build; cd build"
2. Generate Makefile "cmake .."
3. Now build the plugin "make"
4. And the plugin should be built as "gmetric.so", just copy it to the plugins folder "cp gmetric.so ~/.wireshark/plugins/"
 
You need the wireshark headers, the glib-2.0 headers and of course the gcc C compiler.
